# Plant-Leaf-Disease-Detection-Using-CNN

### Tech Used
Python 
HTML 
CSS 
Tensorflow

Developed a machine learning model to accurately detect and classify diseases in plant leaves using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
Aimed to assist farmers and agriculturists in early disease identication to prevent crop losses.
Designed and trained a CNN model with multiple convolutional and pooling layers for feature extraction.

Overcame diculties in recognizing visually similar disease patterns by using deeper layers in the CNN architecture.
